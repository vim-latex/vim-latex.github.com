* remoteOpen.vim:
	Add a command :RemoteOpen which is to be used in applications such as
	YAP to make vim use the same session to open files. (SA)

* texviewer.vim:
	Bug: <F9> did not work in standard vim + cygwin combination.
	Solution: Use single quotes instead of double-quotes when issuing
	          shell commands. (SA)
