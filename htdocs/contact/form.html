<h3>Contact the vim-latex-devel team</h3>

Once upon a time, <a
	href="mailto://vim-latex-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">vim-latex-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>
was an open list which did not restrict unsubscribed people from posting.
Unfortunately, we got too much spam and have decided to make it a closed
list. This means that you can only e-mail vim-latex-devel if you are
subscribed to it. 
<p>
You can contact the list in a number of ways:
<ul>
	<li>If you just to shoot off a quick e-mail, then continue onto the <a
		href="#form">form</a> below. Fill in the required information and
	thats it. E-mail will be sent to you and to the vim-latex-devel group
	on your behalf.  There is no guarantee that the person who replies will
	include you in the the reply although it is usual practice.</li>
	<li>You can also submit a bug report using the <a
		href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=52322&atid=466456">vim-latex
		project bug tracker.</a> Please do this while logged in if
	possible.</li>
	<li>Finally, you can subscribe to the list. Subscribing is easy. Just
	fill in your e-mail address at <a
		href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/vim-latex-devel">this
		page.</a> You will be asked to confirm. vim-latex-devel is
	moderately active list which gets about 3-4 mails per day on
	average.</li>
</ul>
