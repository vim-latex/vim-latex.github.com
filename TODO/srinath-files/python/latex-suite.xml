		Latex-Suite attempts to provide a comprehensive set of tools to
		view, edit and compile LaTeX documents in Vim. Together, they
		provide tools starting from macros to speed up editing LaTeX
		documents to functions for forward searching .dvi documents.
		Latex-suite has been possible because of the contributions of many
		people. Please see <tag>latex-suite-credits</tag> for a list of
		people who have helped.

		If you are viewing this in vim 6.0+, then the sections should appear
		folded (see <tag>folding</tag>). Use <tag>za</tag> to toggle back and

	<note>
		If the sections do not appear folded, press za in normal mode. This
		will fold up everything and it will be much easier to navigate.

			Latex-Suite works best if you have the following settings in your ~/.vimrc:
		</para>
		<code>" this line is responsible for loading latex-suite when a .tex file is
" opened.
filetype plugin on
" for automatic indentation specific to LaTeX.
filetype indent on
		</code>
		<para>
			In addition, the following settings could go in your ~/.vim/ftplugin/tex.vim
			file:
		</para>
		<code>" this is mostly a matter of taste. but LaTeX looks good with just a bit
" of indentation.
set sw=2
" TIP: if you write your \label's as \label{fig:something}, then if you
" type in \ref{fig: and press &lt;C-n&gt; you will automatically cycle through 
" all the figure labels. Very useful!
set iskeyword+=:
" IMPORTANT: If you are a win32 user, then the following setting is
" necessary in order to have latex called correctly from within vim.
set shellslash

			The mappings in latex-suite are by default prefixed with the back-tick
			character. For example, `/ inserts \frac{<++>}{<++>}<++> etc. You can change the
			prefix with the following setting.
			',', '/', '`' are preferred values. '' or '\' will lead to a _lot_ of
			trouble.

			g:Tex_Leader is also used for visual mode mappings for fonts.
