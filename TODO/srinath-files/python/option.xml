    The mappings in latex-suite are by default prefixed with the back-tick
    character. For example, `/ inserts \frac{<++>}{<++>}<++> etc. You can change the
    prefix with the following setting.
    ',', '/', '`' are preferred values. '' or '\' will lead to a _lot_ of
    trouble.

    g:Tex_Leader is also used for visual mode mappings for fonts.
