        <h1>A (very) quick start to Latex-Suite</h1>
        <h2>First things first</h2>
        Assuming you have Vim 6.0+ already up and running, follow the
        instructions <a
            href="http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/index.php?subject=download">here</a>
        to set up Latex-Suite.
        <br/>
        <b>Time taken</b>: 2 mins (not including download times)

        <h2>Inserting a template</h2>
        Start up gvim and begin editing a new file.
        <pre>e newfile.tex</pre>
        If the installation went well, you should see a new set of
        menus appear. Goto <tt>Tex-Suite &gt; Templates</tt>. You will see
        a number of templates to choose from. For now, choose to insert a
        template for an article. You should get the following in the main
        vim window (after possibly a hit-enter prompt)<br/>.
        <img src=""></img><br/>
        The cursor is left at a position from where you can start typing
        straight away. Trying to lessen movement is a recurring theme in
        Latex-Suite.
        <h2>Inserting a package</h2>
        Assume that we are writing a mathematical paper and we want to use
        the popular amsmath package. We will use some functionality which
        Latex-Suite provides specifically for including LaTeX packages,
        providing options etc. Navigate to before the
        <tt>\begin{document}</tt> line (The portion of the document
        before the <tt>\begin{document}</tt> is called the
        <em>preamble</em> in LaTeX). On an empty line in the preamble,
        press <tt>&lt;F5&gt;</tt>. You should see a prompt asking you to
        choose from a list of "supported" packages. Type in the number
        corresponding to the amsmath package. You should see the following
        line inserted into the vim window
        <pre>\usepackage[]{amsmath}<++></pre>
        with the cursor positioned conviniently between the
        <tt>[]</tt>'s. For now, do not worry about the trailing <tt><++></tt>
        at the end of this line. Assume we want to provide the
        <tt>sumlimits</tt> options to amsmath. You can either type in this
        option manually, or choose from a menu of package options which
        Latex-Suite automatically creates when you insert a package using
        <tt>&lt;F5&gt;</tt>.  With the cursor still placed between the
        <tt>[]</tt>, goto <tt>TeX-Suite &gt; Packages &gt; amsmath
            Options</tt>. Choose the <tt>sumlimits</tt> option. The package
        line should get converted to:
        <pre>\usepackage[sumlimits,]{amsmath}<++></pre>
        with the cursor before <tt>]</tt>. Press <tt>&lt;C-j&gt;</tt> in
        insert mode. You will see the cursor jump to the end of the package
        line and the trailing <tt><++></tt> will dissapear. What just
        happened?! You had your first taste of <em>Placeholders</em>. Read
        more about them (later) <a href="">here</a>. In short, pressing
        <tt>&lt;C-j&gt;</tt> in insert mode takes you to the next
        <tt><++></tt> in the text.

        <h2>Inserting an Environment</h2>
        Now let us type in a simple formula in LaTeX. Move back to the body
        of the document (The portion of the document between
        <tt>\begin{document}</tt> and <tt>\end{document}</tt> is called the
        body). Type in a few simple sentences and then on an empty line
        press <tt>&lt;F5&gt;</tt>. (Remember: <tt>&lt;F5&gt;</tt> is very
        useful!) Once again, you will get a prompt, but this time you will
        be asked to choose an environment.  Several common latex
        environments are listed. For now, choose the <tt>eqnarray</tt>
        option (either by entering the number, or writing <tt>eqnarray</tt>
        on the prompt). You should get the following inserted into the
        file:
        <pre>\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{}<++>
\end{eqnarray}<++></pre>
        with the cursor between the <tt>{}</tt>. Enter a label. We will use
        <tt>eqn:euler</tt>. After typing in <tt>eqn:euler</tt>, press
        <tt>&lt;C-j&gt;</tt>. This will take you outside the curly-braces.
        Another time you used a Placeholder!
        <h3>A few keyboard shortcuts</h3> 
        Now to type in the famous Euler formula. Our aim is to type
        <pre>e^{j\pi} + 1 &amp;=&amp; 0</pre>
        Instead of typing this blindly, let us use a few shortcuts to
        reduce movement. Start out by typing <tt>e^</tt>. Now instead of
        typing <tt>{</tt>, type another <tt>^</tt>. You will see the
        <tt>e^^</tt> change instantly to <tt>e^{}<++></tt> with the cursor
        between <tt>{}</tt>'s. (The <tt>^^</tt> changed to
        <tt>^{}<++></tt>.) Continue with the following sequence of letters:
        <tt>j`p</tt>. This will change instantly to <tt>j\pi</tt>. (The
        <tt>`p</tt> changed to <tt>\pi</tt>.) Having typed in all we need
        to type between the <tt>{}</tt>'s, press <tt>&lt;C-j&gt;</tt>. You
        will pop back out of the curly-braces. Continue typing the rest of
        the formula. You can use <tt>==</tt> as a shortcut for
        <tt>&amp;=&amp;</tt>. Latex-Suite provides a large number of such
        shortcuts which should making typing much more fun and fast if you
        get acquainted with them. A list is provided <a
            href="">here</a>. Definitely spend some time getting a feel for
        them. Most of them are pretty intuitive like <tt>`/</tt> for
        <tt>\frac{}{}</tt>, <tt>`8</tt> for <tt>\infty</tt> etc.
        <p>
        In order to understand the next section better, it will be helpful
        to have one more <tt>\label</tt>. Lets use the handy
        <tt>&lt;F5&gt;</tt>
        key to insert another equation. This time something simple like
        <pre>\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eqn:simple}
    1 + 1 = 2
\end{eqnarray}</pre>
        will do.
        </p>

        <h2>Inserting a Reference</h2>
        A necessary part of LaTeX editing is referencing equations,
        figures, bibliographic entries etc. This is done with the
        <tt>\ref</tt> and the <tt>\cite</tt> commands. Latex-Suite provides
        an easy way to do this. Somewhere in the body of the document, type
        in the following sentence
        <pre>This is a reference to (\ref{}).</pre>
        With the cursor between the <tt>{}</tt> press <tt>&lt;F9&gt;</tt>.
        You will notice a selection box opens up as follows
        <br/>
        <img></img>
        <br/>
        You can scroll up and down in the middle window till you reach the
        reference you want to insert. Notice how when you scroll in the
        middle window, the bottom "Preview" window scrolls automatically to
        show you the location of the current selection. This helps you
        identify the reference with greater ease because often times,
        <tt>\labels</tt> are not descriptive enough or there might be too
        many of them. To insert the reference, just position the cursor on
        the relevant line in the middle window and press
        <tt>&lt;enter&gt;</tt>. The line which you were editing will change
        to
        <pre>This is a reference to (\ref{eqn:euler})</pre>
        and the bottom windows close automatically.

        <p>The <tt>&lt;F9&gt;</tt> key also works for inserting
        <tt>\cite</tt> commands to reference bibliographich entries,
        inserting file names for the <tt>\input</tt> command and just plain
        searching for words. See <a href="">here</a> for more information.
