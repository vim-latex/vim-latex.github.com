        <h1>A (very) quick start to Latex-Suite</h1>
        <h2>First things first</h2>
        Assuming you have Vim 6.0+ already up and running, follow the
        instructions <a
            href="http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/index.php?subject=download">here</a>
        to set up Latex-Suite.
        <br/>
        <b>Time taken</b>: 2 mins (not including download times)

        <h2>Inserting a template</h2>
        Start up gvim and begin editing a new file.
        <pre>e newfile.tex</pre>
        If the installation went well, you should see a new set of
        menus appear. Goto <tt>Tex-Suite &gt; Templates</tt>. You will see
        a number of templates to choose from. For now, choose to insert a
        template for an article. You should get the following in the main
        vim window (after possibly a hit-enter prompt)<br/>.
        <img src=""></img><br/>
        The cursor is left at a position from where you can start typing
        straight away. Trying to lessen movement is a recurring theme in
        Latex-Suite.
        <h2>Inserting a package</h2>
        Assume that we are writing a mathematical paper and we want to use
        the popular amsmath package. We will use some functionality which
        Latex-Suite provides specifically for including LaTeX packages,
        providing options etc. Navigate to before the
        <tt>\begin{document}</tt> line (The portion of the document
        before the <tt>\begin{document}</tt> is called the
        <em>preamble</em> in LaTeX). On an empty line in the preamble,
        press <tt>&lt;F5&gt;</tt>. You should see a prompt asking you to
        choose from a list of "supported" packages. Type in the number
        corresponding to the amsmath package. You should see the following
        line inserted into the vim window
        <pre>\usepackage[]{amsmath}<++></pre>
        with the cursor positioned conviniently between the
        <tt>[]</tt>'s. For now, do not worry about the trailing <tt><++></tt>
        at the end of this line. Assume we want to provide the
        <tt>sumlimits</tt> options to amsmath. You can either type in this
        option manually, or choose from a menu of package options which
        Latex-Suite automatically creates when you insert a package using
        <tt>&lt;F5&gt;</tt>.  With the cursor still placed between the
        <tt>[]</tt>, goto <tt>TeX-Suite &gt; Packages &gt; amsmath
            Options</tt>. Choose the <tt>sumlimits</tt> option. The package
        line should get converted to:
        <pre>\usepackage[sumlimits,]{amsmath}<++></pre>
        with the cursor before <tt>]</tt>. Press <tt>&lt;C-j&gt;</tt> in
        insert mode. You will see the cursor jump to the end of the package
        line and the trailing <tt><++></tt> will dissapear. What just
        happened?! You had your first taste of <em>Placeholders</em>. Read
        more about them (later) <a href="">here</a>. In short, pressing
        <tt>&lt;C-j&gt;</tt> in insert mode takes you to the next
        <tt><++></tt> in the text.

        <h2>Inserting an Environment</h2>
        Now let us type in a simple formula in LaTeX. Move back to the body
        of the document (The portion of the document between
        <tt>\begin{document}</tt> and <tt>\end{document}</tt> is called the
        body). Type in a few simple sentences and then on an empty line
        press <tt>&lt;F5&gt;</tt>. (Remember: <tt>&lt;F5&gt;</tt> is very
        useful!) Once again, you will get a prompt, but this time you will
        be asked to choose an environment.  Several common latex
        environments are listed. For now, choose the <tt>eqnarray</tt>
        option (either by entering the number, or writing <tt>eqnarray</tt>
        on the prompt). You should get the following inserted into the
        file:
        <pre>\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{}<++>
\end{eqnarray}<++></pre>
        with the cursor between the <tt>{}</tt>. Enter a label. We will use
        <tt>eqn:euler</tt>. After typing in <tt>eqn:euler</tt>, press
        <tt>&lt;C-j&gt;</tt>. This will take you outside the curly-braces.
        Another time you used a Placeholder!
        <h3>A few keyboard shortcuts</h3> 
        Now to type in the famous Euler formula. Our aim is to type
        <pre>e^{j\pi} + 1 &amp;=&amp; 0</pre>
        Instead of typing this blindly, let us use a few shortcuts to
        reduce movement. Start out by typing <tt>e^</tt>. Now instead of
        typing <tt>{</tt>, type another <tt>^</tt>. You will see the
        <tt>e^^</tt> change instantly to <tt>e^{}<++></tt> with the cursor
        between <tt>{}</tt>'s. (The <tt>^^</tt> changed to
        <tt>^{}<++></tt>.) Continue with the following sequence of letters:
        <tt>j`p</tt>. This will change instantly to <tt>j\pi</tt>. (The
        <tt>`p</tt> changed to <tt>\pi</tt>.) Having typed in all we need
        to type between the <tt>{}</tt>'s, press <tt>&lt;C-j&gt;</tt>. You
        will pop back out of the curly-braces. Continue typing the rest of
        the formula. You can use <tt>==</tt> as a shortcut for
        <tt>&amp;=&amp;</tt>. Latex-Suite provides a large number of such
        shortcuts which should making typing much more fun and fast if you
        get acquainted with them. A list is provided <a
            href="">here</a>. Definitely spend some time getting a feel for
        them. Most of them are pretty intuitive like <tt>`/</tt> for
        <tt>\frac{}{}</tt>, <tt>`8</tt> for <tt>\infty</tt> etc.
        <p>
        In order to understand the next section better, it will be helpful
        to have one more <tt>\label</tt>. Lets use the handy
        <tt>&lt;F5&gt;</tt>
        key to insert another equation. This time something simple like
        <pre>\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eqn:simple}
    1 + 1 = 2
\end{eqnarray}</pre>
        will do.
        </p>

        <h2>Inserting a Reference</h2>
        A necessary part of LaTeX editing is referencing equations,
        figures, bibliographic entries etc. This is done with the
        <tt>\ref</tt> and the <tt>\cite</tt> commands. Latex-Suite provides
        an easy way to do this. Somewhere in the body of the document, type
        in the following sentence
        <pre>This is a reference to (\ref{}).</pre>
		With the cursor between the <tt>{}</tt> press <tt>&lt;F9&gt;</tt>
		in insert mode.  You will notice a selection box opens up as
		follows
        <br/>
        <img></img>
        <br/>
        You can scroll up and down in the middle window till you reach the
        reference you want to insert. Notice how when you scroll in the
        middle window, the bottom "Preview" window scrolls automatically to
        show you the location of the current selection. This helps you
        identify the reference with greater ease because often times,
        <tt>\labels</tt> are not descriptive enough or there might be too
        many of them. To insert the reference, just position the cursor on
        the relevant line in the middle window and press
        <tt>&lt;enter&gt;</tt>. The line which you were editing will change
        to
        <pre>This is a reference to (\ref{eqn:euler})</pre>
        and the bottom windows close automatically.

        <p>The <tt>&lt;F9&gt;</tt> key also works for inserting
        <tt>\cite</tt> commands to reference bibliographich entries,
		inserting file names for the <tt>\inputgraphics</tt> command and
		just plain searching for words. Click <a href="">here</a> for more
		information.

		<h2>Compiling a document</h2>
		Great! We have just created a small latex file. The next step is to
		make the latex compiler create a .dvi file from it. Compiling via
		latex-suite is simple. Goto normal mode and press <tt>\ll</tt>
		(replace <tt>\</tt> with whatever <tt>mapleader</tt> setting you
		have). This will call the latex compiler. If all goes well, then
		the focus should return to the vim window. 
		
		<h3>Debugging LaTeX source files</h3>
		To illustrate the debugging procedure, let's create a few mistakes
		in the file:
		<pre>This is a $\mistake$.
And this is $\another$</pre>
		Now press <tt>\ll</tt> again. This time you will notice that after
		compilation finishes, the cursor automatically lands on
		<tt>$\mistake$</tt>. In addition, 2 new windows will appear as
		shown here:
		<br/>
		<img></img>
		<br/>
		The middle window is an <em>Error List</em> window showing you the
		errors which the latex compiler found. Th bottom window is a
		<em>Log Preview</em> window, which shows you the context of the
		error made by displaying the relevant portion of the <tt>.log</tt>
		file created during the latex compilation procedure. Jump to the
		<em>Error List</em> window and try scrolling around in it using
		either the <tt>j, k</tt> keys or the arrow keys. You will notice
		that the <em>Log Preview</em> window scrolls automatically to
		retain the context of the error you are currently located on. If
		you press <tt>&lt;enter&gt;</tt> on any line, you will see the
		cursor jump to the location of the error. Latex-Suite tries to
		guess the column location as best as it can so you can continue
		typing straight away.
		<p>
		Having got a taste for compiling, proceed by deleting the erroneous
		lines and re-compiling.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Latex-Suite compiler is capable of much more including
		selectively filtering out common errors which you might want to
		ignore for the moment, compiling parts of a document, setting
		levels of verbosity in the compiler output etc. See <a
			href="">here</a> for more.
		</p>

		<h2>Viewing DVI files</h2>
		Now that you have compiled your first latex source, its time to
		view it. Again, this should be pretty simple. Press
		<tt>\lv</tt> in normal mode. Depending on your platform, a DVI
		viewer program should open up and display the dvi file generated in
		compilation step previously.
		<h3>Performing forward searches</h3>
		<p>
		If you are using a modern DVI viewer, then it is possible to do
		what is called forward and inverse searching. However, you will
		need to customize the standard Latex-Suite distribution in order to
		utilize this functionality. Type in the following on the command
		line:
		<pre>:let g:Tex_CompileRule_dvi = 'latex -src-specials -interaction=nonstopmode $*'
:TCTarget dvi</pre>
		Now recompile the latex file by pressing <tt>\ll</tt>. This time,
		instead of pressing <tt>\lv</tt> to view the file, press
		<tt>\ls</tt> from within the tex file. If the DVI viewer supports
		forward searching (most of them do), then the viewer will actually
		display the portion of the DVI file corresponding to the location
		where you were editing the tex file.
		</p>
		<p>
		(The reason Latex-Suite does not have this setting by default is
		that on some systems this causes unpredictable results in the DVI
		output. If you find the DVI output satisfactory, then you can
		insert the first of the 2 lines above into your
		<tt>$VIM/ftplugin/tex.vim</tt> file. <tt>$VIM</tt> is
		<tt>~/vimfiles</tt> for windows and <tt>~/.vim</tt> for *nix
		machines).
		</p>
		<h3>Performing inverse searches</h3>
		Most DVI viewers also support inverse searching, whereby you can
		make the DVI viewer ask vim to display the tex source corresponding
		to the DVI file being shown. This is extremeley helpful while
		proofreading large documents.
		<p>
		Simply double-click anywhere in the viewer window. If the viewer
		supports it, then it will attempt to open an editor window at the
		location corresponding to where you double-clicked. On *nix
		platforms, Latex-Suite attempts to start the viewer program in such
		a way that it already knows to use vim to open the tex source. Thus
		you should see a vim window open up showing the tex file. However,
		if there is an error, or some other program is used, you will need
		to tell the viewer program to use gvim as the editor.  On windows
		platforms, if you use the commonly available
		<tt>yap</tt> viewer (available as part of the miktex distribution),
		then this option can be set from <tt>View &gt; Options &gt;
			Inverse Search</tt>. In the <tt>Command line:</tt> window,
		write
		<pre>"C:\Program Files\vim\vim61\gvim" -c ":RemoteOpen +%l %f"</pre>
		(Customize the path according to where you have installed gvim).
		If you double click in the view pane now, you will see gvim start
		up and take you to the relevant portion of the tex file.
